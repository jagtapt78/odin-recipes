    <h1>Kheema Recipe</h1>

    <!-- introduction to recipe -->
<p>Kheema is a traditional curry dish from many countries in South Asia.</p>


<p>It consists of ground meat, onions, tomatoes, some herbs and spices, and water for the curry. 
    In  my family, for a lighter taste, we grew up 
    eating this curry with ground turkey, usually 93% lean. Feel free to use
    whatever ground meat you like -- it tastes great with beef, lamb, goat, chicken, or a blend. </p>

    <p>Curry itself is a broad term for many kinds of foods. 
        Most curries incorporate sauteed onions and tomatoes in a two-stage process
        to create a delicious flavor base to roast your spices in. 
    </p>
    <p>After you make this spiced mix, you add your ground meat and cook. My family usually
        pressure cooks the curry to make it quickly without compromising on flavor.
        This also makes the meat a little more tender, which is good if you're
        using a meat like beef or lamb. However, it's optional.</p>
