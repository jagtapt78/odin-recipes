<h1>Salsa Recipe</h1>
<p>This salsa recipe is really flexible, and can even be made boiled instead 
    of roasted in the oven. You can add whatever ingredients you like
    to this basic mixture, like roasted pineapple, other kinds of peppers, 
    mangos, peaches, avocado, or just enjoy it plain.</p>

    <p>The most important components of this recipe fall into 3 groups: tomatoes, aliums, and
        aromatics. The ratios between these three groups is what is so flexible, but for best results,
        make sure you have the basics.</p>
