<h1>Spaghetti Recipe</h1>
<p>Many people learn how to make spaghetti from their parents. It's an easy recipe with only a few ingredients, a simple set of steps, and is 
    very affordable to make.
</p>
<p>My family was much the same. We made spaghetti sauce with a jar of sauce and some extra goodies to make it taste more "gourmet". Then we 
    cooked the pasta and mixed them together. Simple.</p>
    <p>This recipe covers how to make the sauce the way my mother always made it. She used some of her Indian cooking skills 
        and sensibilities to season it, and I always felt the jarred sauce was much better for it. Whenever she felt like we weren't getting enough 
    vegetables, she would add some frozen spinach to the sauce. Occasionally, she would add broccoli or more bell peppers to the sauce too. My family
    didn't really like cheese, so we never ate this with any, but you can add some on top if you want to.

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Jarred Sauce (pick one without any meat or cream in it)</li>
    <li>1 diced yellow or white onion</li>
    <li>1 diced green bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 TBSP neutral flavored oil or light olive oil</li>
    <li>1 TBSP italian seasoning</li>
    <li>3-5 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Boil water for pasta</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan large enough for your sauce and for your pasta.</li>
    <li>Toss in your onions and cook on medium high heat until translucent.</li>
    <li>Add your bell pepper, stirring often so they don't get too overcooked.</li>
    <li>Stir in your italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, minced garlic, and salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Once the mixture in the pan smells good, add your jar of sauce.</li>
    <li>When pasta is al dente, strain and reserve 1/3 cup of cooking water.</li>
    <li>Add your pasta into your sauce and stir, letting the pasta soften in the sauce a little more.</li>
    <li><em>Optional: add some fresh basil leaves sliced into ribbons on top, and sprinkle some more red pepper flakes. . </em>
    </li>
    <li>Serve with some meatballs or
        serve vegetarian.</li>
